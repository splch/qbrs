# Quantile-Based Balanced Sampling Algorithm

The Quantile-Based Balanced Sampling Algorithm is a method for balancing imbalanced datasets, particularly when there is a significant disparity between the number of samples in majority and minority classes. This algorithm helps create a more balanced dataset to improve machine learning model performance by calculating quantiles for each feature and selecting the closest non-minority class samples to each quantile permutation.

## Overview

The algorithm works by calculating quantiles for each feature in the dataset, generating a set of permutations of the quantiles, and selecting the closest non-minority class samples to each quantile permutation to balance the dataset. This process preserves the underlying data distribution while ensuring an equal representation of both majority and minority classes.

## Steps

1. Count the unique non-minority class labels (`c`).

2. Count the minority class samples (`m`).

3. Create an empty set (`d`) and add all minority class samples to it.

4. Calculate the number of quantiles (`q`) for all features (`f`), such that `f^q = c * m`:

  a. `q = log(c * m) / log(f)`

5. For each feature, calculate the `q` quantiles.

6. Generate a set of all permutations of `c` quantiles (`p`).

7. For each feature, sort the non-minority class samples by their distance to each quantile.

8. For each quantile permutation in `p`, add the closest non-minority class sample to set `d`:

  a. Find the closest sample for each quantile permutation in `p`.

  b. Add the closest sample to set `d`.

  c. Remove that sample to avoid selecting it again.

9. Return the balanced dataset `d`.

## Usage

This algorithm can be implemented in various programming languages such as Python, R, or MATLAB. You can use it to preprocess your imbalanced dataset before feeding it to your machine learning model. Please note that you may need to adjust the algorithm according to the specific data structure and requirements of your project.

## Example

Here is a simple example of how to implement the Quantile-Based Balanced Sampling Algorithm in Python using the scikit-learn library:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the Iris dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Implement the Quantile-Based Balanced Sampling Algorithm
# ...

# Split the balanced dataset into training and testing sets
# ...

# Train and evaluate a machine learning model
# ...
```

## Optimizations

Several optimizations can be applied to improve the time and space complexity of the Quantile-Based Balanced Sampling Algorithm. These include efficient quantile computation, parallel processing, partial sorting, reducing the number of permutations, data structure optimization, incremental updates, dimensionality reduction, and sampling techniques.
